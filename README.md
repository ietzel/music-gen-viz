Combinatorics & series/sequences: may be used to determine the number of possible songs written, and to define means in which to algorithmically create them.

Currently need fix for changing bpm from 100 to range of 96-144.

To-do tracks: latch, don't want to fall in love, livin la vida loca, a dream more scarlet than red, I love your smile, los peces en el rio, etc.
