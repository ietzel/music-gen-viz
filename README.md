Series/sequences may be used to define means in which to algorithmically create songs.

Currently need fix for changing bpm from 100 to range of 96-144.

To-do: latch, don't want to fall in love, livin la vida loca, a dream more scarlet than red, I love your smile, los peces en el rio, fadeaway, you're the only, etc.
